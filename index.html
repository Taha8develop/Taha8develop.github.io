                    <h3><b><u>Moment-rigid vs shear Connections</u></b></h3> 
                    <img class="txtleft" src="Moment rigid connection.JPG" alt="image" width="300" height="200">
                        <p id="article-content"> Moment-rigid connections are stiff connections that allow no displacement and rotation of the connected beam whatsoever. 
                                They consist of a rib-stiffner attached to the plate as shown by the figure aside that applies strength onto the steel plate, generating moment resistance against any rotation. 
                                Moment connections are seen to be more stable and reliable than shear connections. However, the main disadvantage of moment-rigid connections is that they are expensive and more time consuming to manufacture and to connect onto the framing of the building, 
                                due to lots of welding work and erection being required. This means labour costs and health/saftey risks related to this connection type can be very high. 
                        </p> 
                        <p id="article-content"> In the other hand, shear connections (known as simple connections) are non-rigid. They allow some form of rotation when flexure bending occurs on the beam, but are vertically stable. 
                                Most common type of shear connections are 'flexible-end steel plates' that connect the cross-section of the beam to the column web or flange outerface.
                                Standard size of the steel-end plates are usually 10-12mm thick, consisting of M20 bolt holes (in most cases) in pairs for the connection to be bolted into the column web, whilst the beam section is welded to the plate.
                                Shear connections are time-saving, cheap, flexible and easy to connect. However, rigidity is limited and it can allow significant bending-deflection for larger span beams.

                    <img class="txtright" src="Reinforced concrete floor slab .JPG" alt="" width="300" height="200">  
                        <p id="article-content"> Reinforced concrete slabs are the most trusted type of flooring system by civil engineers. The reinforcement bars give tensile strength to the slab, allowing it to be resistive to bending force and preventing it from cracking.
                                As shown in the figure aside, a steel deck plate is layed and bolted into the beam's upper-flange using shear bolts to add lateral restraint to the upper-flange and prevent it from deflecting.
                                Total vertical thickness of the steel plates range between 40-80mm, depending on the span size between each beam. Next on top of the deck-plate goes the reinforcement bars in layers; a lower layer, a middle layer and an upper layer.
                                Once the longitudal bars are placed in the correct location they are contained and lateraly tightened with 'hooks bars', to prevent movement or dislocation.
                                Eventaully, concrete is poured into the flooring zone until it fully covers the steel bars, with formwork edges being used as temporary barriers to lateraly prevent the concrete from flowing side-ways away from the inteneded zone.
                                It would take approximately 28 days for concrete to fully dry and settle, which is why the formwork edges shall not be removed until the duration completes. 
                                Reinforced-concrete slabs can act as a diaphgram and transfer lateral load horizontaly onto the vertical columns in parallel with the primary beams.
                        </p>
                        <p id="article-content"> An alternative approach for flooring system is precast concrete units. Each precast unit will cover the length of a full span for it to be placed on the beams's upper-flanges from both ends.
                                The units will be aligned next to each other for the insitu concrete to be poured into the voids generated between each unit, adding lateral restraint to the precast units to prevent them from dislocating. 
                                The main advantage of using precast concrete units is that they are pre-made in a workshop and transported onsite for them to be immediatley erected and bolted onto the beam's upper flange. The drawback is in the lifting and erection of these precast units which create health/safety risks and additional costs related to labour and machinery.

                    <img class="txtleft" src="Brickwork Facade Cladding .JPG" alt="" width="300" height="200"> 
                        <p id="article-content"> Masonary brickwork cladding is one of the most commonly used cladding type in the UK. Most cavity walls are used for insulation purposes, were the inner layer consist of large sized blocks connected via mortar.
                                The outer layer is a brickwork layer made up of standard sized masonary brick units mortared together. In betweem the inner and outer layer is a cavity layer (empty gap), were the insulation sits in for heating and thermal efficiency.
                                Standard UK sizing for masonary bricks fall under two categories; metric size and imperial size. As for metric size, a 225mm x 112.5mm x 75mm (including 10mm mortar) is used, whilst for imperial it's 238mm x 120mm x 90mm (including 10mm mortar).

                        <p id="article-content">
                                Over the last decade or more, the increase in the number of heat-insulated buildings has been significant. Likewise, many old terraced homes have been embedded with different kinds of insulalating systems to improve their energy efficiency.
                                There is a variety of different types of insulating materials, all with their own pros and cons. For example, mineral wool cavity Batts, EPS polystyrene beads, Cellulose fibre insulation, polyurethane foam insulation and others.
